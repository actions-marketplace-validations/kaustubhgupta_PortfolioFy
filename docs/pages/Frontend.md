# Frontend

This is a web-based project and requires constant CSS, JS, and HTML updates. The HTML is directly generated by the [Python scripts](./pages/Python-Backend) with information filled. This action aims to commit minimum files (ideally 1) to the user's repo and therefore, we cannot create multiple files. 

One thing that is being implemented is that in another repo, [themescss](https://github.com/kaustubhgupta/themescss), you can put the CSS and JS files can call them in HTML. These files will serve as a custom CDN. 

You can come up with different themes, implement them with fake data, and then pass it to the python devs so that they can integrate the data flow for you. 

The CSS and JS if used should be uploaded on [themescss](https://github.com/kaustubhgupta/themescss) and used in HTML. For instance, the example below calls the level_2 CSS:
```html
<link href="https://kaustubhgupta.github.io/themescss/level2.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
